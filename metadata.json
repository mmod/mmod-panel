    "description": "Upgrades the Topbar in Gnome3, creating a customizable panel and providing options for fine-tuning your Desktop Experience.\n\nFeatures include:\n\u25B8 Set comfort levels to provide theme support and fine-tune the overall look and feel of the panel.\n\u25B8 Set the location/position of the panel (bottom by default).\n\u25B8 Add a button to the panel in place of the activities link, using an icon of your preference.\n\u25B8 Auto-hide the panel when not active/in-focus (makes use of pressure/gesture for showing the panel).\n\u25B8 Display and manage your favorites/running apps directly on the panel.\n\u25B8 Move the date menu to the aggregate/tray area.\n\u25B8 Access and manage your extension preferences directly from the aggregate menu.\n\u25B8 Customize behavior of the overview and panel(hot-corners/animations/effects) to suit your preferences.\n\u25B8 More to come soon!\n\nThis project is loosely based on the Panel Settings extension:\nhttps://github.com/eddiefullmetal/gnome-shell-extensions/tree/master/panelSettings%40eddiefullmetal.gr\n\nSadly, Panel Settings has not seen any maintenance in over 2 years, though this is why I decided to create MMOD Panel.\n\nI also took inspiration from the following Gnome extensions: System-Monitor, Taskbar, and DashToDock.\n\nFor those of you who are wondering, the theme used in the screen shot is the Zukitwo-Dark-Shell Shell Theme; \neverything else is default Gnome on Debian Jessie. However, the author of the aforementioned shell theme has \nchanged the name for various reasons to Ciliora-Prima-Shell - which can be found here:\n\n  http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=165096\n\nVersion 7 (1.1.1-7) for Gnome-Shell: 3.10, 3.12, 3.12.2, 3.14, 3.14.4, 3.16, 3.16.2, 3.18\nRik <rik@mmogp.com>\n\nGerman Translation(s) for MMOD-Panel courtesy of Jonius Zeidler <jonatan_zeidler@gmx.de>\n\nSource Repository: https://code.mmogp.com/mmod/mmod-panel/\n",
